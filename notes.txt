### data level methods:
 
##ROS: sample from each class an equal amount of samples
##RUS: normally like above, but not possible with that little data
##2Phase: first pretrained on ROS balanced dataset, then finetune it 
##threshold: network decisionis adjusted during test phase based on prior probability
##dynamic sampling: sample examples from class which is more errorneous

#threshold: adjust them during the test phase, keep a look at false positives are better than false negatives
#dynamic: done by creating a new sampler in sampler.py
#ROS/RUS: done by creating a new sampler in sampler.py
#2Phase: simply train first on RUS (not good for me, dynamically could be better) and then on normal imbalanced dataset
